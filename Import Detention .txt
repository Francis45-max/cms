IMPORT DETENTION

What Is a Detention Fee?
A detention fee is assessed on containers that are outside of ports and facilities. It is charged for the time your freight leaves the terminal until it is returned empty. When you are using a carrier’s equipment beyond the contract, regardless of whether it is full or empty, you will incur a detention fee if it is not returned within the allotted “free time”. 

Who Enforces Detention Fees?
Detention fees are paid on a per diem basis to the carrier who owns the equipment/container that you are utilizing. Terminals, ports, and container yards will charge a detention fee per container per day if their equipment is not returned based on your set contract. 

Situations When Detention Fees Apply
Detention fees apply when you continue to utilize a shipping container outside of your agreed upon contract. The carriers need to have their equipment constantly in circulation. 

When you do not return your container within the agreed upon time, it delays the carrier from allowing another company to utilize it. Detention fees are applied to offset that loss and to discourage shippers from using storage containers for extended periods of time.
